Reference Pixel Correction
**************************

This step corrects for drifts in the counts due to the readout electronics using the reference pixels.
The correction is done for each pixel from amplifier-to-amplifier in a given group and from group-to-group.
The drift per row or column (depending on the instrument) seems to be the same for all amplifiers and it seems
to also depend on the row/column being odd or even. The algorithm is different for NIR and MIR detectors.Â
